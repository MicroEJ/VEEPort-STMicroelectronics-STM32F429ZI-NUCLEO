### MicroEJ not applicable, based on the file TLT-MicroEJ_MISRA_rules version 1.5A

# Please uncomment the required misra rules to ignore if your project has only detections that match the generic justification.

# A project should not contain unused type declarations
# Generic justification: A type can be defined at API level and not used by the application
#misra-c2012-2.3

# A project should not contain unused tag declarations
# Generic justification: A tag can be defined at API level and not used by the application
#misra-c2012-2.4

# A project should not contain unused macro declarations
# Generic justification: A macro can be defined at API level and not used by the application
#misra-c2012-2.5

# Trigraphs should not be used
# Generic justification: Can be used in simple cases
#misra-c2012-4.2

# An external object or function shall be declared once in one and only one file
# Generic justification: Needed when has to be used in API implementation and not visible in C header file
#misra-c2012-8.5

# Conversions shall not be performed between a pointer to an incomplete type and any other type
# Generic justification: Used for code genericity/abstraction 
#misra-c2012-11.2

# A cast shall not be performed between a pointer to object type and a pointer to a different object type
# Generic justification: Used by many C framework to factorize code
#misra-c2012-11.3

# A conversion should not be performed between a pointer to object and an integer type
# Generic justification: Used when coding BSP C source code (drivers, etc.) 
#misra-c2012-11.4

# A conversion should not be performed from pointer to void into pointer to object
# Generic justification: Used for code genericity/abstraction
#misra-c2012-11.5

# A function parameter should not be modified
# Generic justification: Can be usefull when designing C library
#misra-c2012-17.8

# The +, -, += and -= operators should not be applied to an expression of pointer type
# Generic justification: Can be used in configurable C library
#misra-c2012-18.4

# The union keyword should not be used
# Generic justification: Can be usefull when designing C library
#misra-c2012-19.2

# The #include directive shall be followed by either a or "filename" sequence
# Generic justification: Can be used in configurable C library
#misra-c2012-20.3

# The # and ## preprocessor operators should not be used
# Generic justification: Used by MicroEJ architectures
#misra-c2012-20.10

# A macro parameter used as an operand to the # or ## operators, which is itself subject to further macro replacement, shall only be used as an operand to these operators
# Generic justification: Used by legacy LL APIs C header files automatically generated
#misra-c2012-20.12

# The memory allocation and deallocation functions of <stdlib.h> shall not be used
# Generic justification: Usage sometime forced by BSP
#misra-c2012-21.3

# The standard header file <signal.h> shall not beused
# Generic justification: Used by POSIX platforms
#misra-c2012-21.5

# The Standard Library input/output functions shall not be used
# Generic justification: Used for printf usage
#misra-c2012-21.6

# The atof, atoi, atol and atoll functions of <stdlib.h> shall not be used
# Generic justification: Usefull for NET Low Level part
#misra-c2012-21.7

# The library functions abort, exit, getenv and system of <stdlib.h> shall not be used
# Generic justification: Used by POSIX platforms 
#misra-c2012-21.8

# Please add here misra rule exclusions in specific files. These exclusions must be compliant with the file TLT-MicroEJ_MISRA_rules
# and must be preceded by a justification that matches all cases.

# Here is a justification example comment for the rule x.x in the file file_example.c
